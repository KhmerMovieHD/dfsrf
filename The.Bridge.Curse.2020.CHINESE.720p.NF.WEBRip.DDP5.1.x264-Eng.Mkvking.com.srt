<i>It feels so spooky here at night.</i>

2
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:52,458
<i>I feel rather uncomfortable.</i>

3
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:55,291
<i>Whose idea is it
to hold the test of courage here?</i>

4
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,333
<i>What if ghosts appear?</i>

5
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:59,041
<i>Isn't it too late to say that?</i>

6
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:00,750
<i>"Just don't turn your head on the stairs."</i>

7
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,833
<i>The rumor is meant to scare the juniors.</i>

8
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:04,333
<i>-And you believe it?
-It seems real!</i>

9
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:06,333
<i>-How did the girl die?
-She was killed.</i>

10
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:08,208
<i>-Bullshit.
-Hush! It's starting.</i>

11
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:11,083
<i>Attention please, juniors.</i>

12
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:13,125
<i>This year, the test of courage</i>

13
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:15,041
<i>is held at the forbidden spot
in Tung Hu University,</i>

14
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:16,500
<i>the Female Ghost Bridge.</i>

15
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:19,291
<i>You guys will be starting from here.</i>

16
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,458
<i>When you hear the bell,</i>

17
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:22,958
<i>take off the red cloth</i>

18
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,583
<i>and circle around the lake.</i>

19
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:26,666
<i>Go.</i>

20
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:34,625
<i>Please do remember.</i>

21
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:36,541
<i>No matter what happens,</i>

22
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:39,250
<i>never turn your head on the stairs.</i>

23
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:41,958
<i>One, two.</i>

24
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:42,958
<i>What is he doing?</i>

25
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:44,416
<i>-Why is he counting the steps?
-Three.</i>

26
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,208
<i>-Didn't we agree not to count?
-Four, five.</i>

27
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:47,375
<i>-Let him count.
-Six.</i>

28
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:50,166
<i>-It's more exciting.
-Seven, eight.</i>

29
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,541
<i>-No, we can't do that.
-Nine.</i>

30
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:53,291
<i>-Wen-yao, stop counting!
-Wen-yao!</i>

31
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:55,916
<i>-Ten, eleven, twelve.
-Wen-yao!</i>

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
<i>Thirteen.</i>

33
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,916
<i>-Wen-yao!
-Fourteen.</i>

34
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:03,291
<i>Where has he gone to?</i>

35
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:09,916
<i>Wait.</i>

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,583
<i>Did we just turn around on the steps?</i>

37
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,291
<i>-No.
-Did we?</i>

38
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:22,958
<i>What was that?</i>

39
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,666
FEBRUARY 28, 2020

40
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:53,791
<i>Test the sound.</i>

41
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,500
<i>One, two, three, four.</i>

RECORD OF SUPERNATURAL STORIES ON CAMPUSES

43
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:07,166
<i>Numerous ghost stories
have been circulating</i>

44
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,541
<i>among students in many colleges.</i>

45
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,333
<i>Like the haunted elevator
at Chinese Culture University.</i>

46
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:14,708
<i>The Moon Lake at Taiwan University.</i>

47
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,291
<i>The Lixing campus
at Cheng Kung University.</i>

48
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,583
<i>Meanwhile, Tung Hu University
that was founded 62 years ago</i>

49
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:22,583
<i>is a hotbed for ghost stories.</i>

50
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,875
<i>The best-known forbidden spot</i>

51
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:27,750
<i>is the Female Ghost Bridge.</i>

52
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,291
<i>It was built for the convenience
of the students.</i>

53
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,416
<i>It didn't have a name back then.</i>

54
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,083
<i>Later, rumor has it</i>

55
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,291
<i>that a girl was dumped by her boyfriend.</i>

56
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,208
<i>She had waited for him till midnight.</i>

57
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:41,625
<i>In the end, she couldn't take it
and drowned herself in the lake.</i>

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,291
<i>Since then,
an extra step would suddenly appear</i>

59
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:45,583
<i>on the stairs</i>

60
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:46,916
<i>at midnight.</i>

61
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:50,416
Today is February 28, 2020.

62
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:51,791
It's a very special year.

63
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:52,916
A leap year.

64
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:54,708
<i>Four years ago, today,</i>

65
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:57,541
<i>a clip of a test of courage
was posted online.</i>

66
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,291
<i>A white shadow appeared in the end.</i>

67
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,916
<i>Let's find out if it is the legendary...</i>

68
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:03,333
ghost.

69
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:09,208
The most terrifying thing is that
all five students in the clip had died.

70
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,125
<i>Their bodies were found
scattered around campus.</i>

71
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,125
<i>It should have been a case
that shocked the entire country,</i>

72
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,125
<i>but no one followed it up.</i>

73
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,458
RISKING LIVES FOR TEST OF COURAGE

74
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,291
<i>Was it due to the pressure
from the university</i>

75
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,708
<i>that the police covered it up?</i>

76
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,458
<i>Or did the ghost</i>

77
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:25,916
<i>drive them to commit suicide?</i>

78
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,416
Let me find out about the truth.

79
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,625
They say that at midnight,

80
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:33,708
an extra step will appear

81
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:36,166
on the original 13-step stairs
on the Female Ghost Bridge.

82
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,208
At that moment, never turn your head

83
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,666
because the ghost might be
right behind you.

84
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:43,791
{\an8}<i>Today is February 28,
the date the incident happened.</i>

85
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:46,708
{\an8}<i>Let's check how many steps there are
during the day.</i>

86
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:52,708
{\an8}<i>One, two, three, four, five,</i>

87
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:56,916
{\an8}<i>six, seven, eight, nine, ten,</i>

88
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:59,416
{\an8}<i>eleven, twelve, thirteen--</i>

89
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,125
{\an8}<i>I'm sorry. One more take.</i>

90
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:06,500
<i>Are you okay?</i>

91
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:07,541
<i>I'm fine.</i>

92
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:09,833
{\an8}<i>You were a news anchor.</i>

93
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,541
Why did they send you to do this?

94
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,750
Don't pick on my wound.

95
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:16,041
No one watches the morning news anyway.

96
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,750
At least, these are real.

97
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,375
Things that really happened.

98
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,333
So, you think the story is true?

99
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,416
The ghost killed people?

100
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,458
{\an8}<i>There is always some truth in a story.</i>

101
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,791
{\an8}<i>Never believe what you see on the surface.</i>

102
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,000
{\an8}<i>I'll definitely dig something up.</i>

103
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:34,083
{\an8}<i>Don't worry. I'll get my old job back.</i>

104
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,416
{\an8}<i>The price you pay for surviving
is so high.</i>

105
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:38,708
<i>Here.</i>

106
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:40,125
<i>Ready?</i>

107
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,125
<i>Wait.</i>

108
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,250
{\an8}<i>Let's start when you're ready.</i>

109
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,458
{\an8}<i>Five, four, three, two...</i>

110
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,875
<i>Let's see how Sung and Yu-ching</i>

111
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,541
<i>get on with the props.</i>

112
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:07,875
<i>Hey, can't you borrow a normal classroom?</i>

113
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:10,125
<i>Well, I only have keys
to the classrooms in my department--</i>

114
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,041
<i>So many eyes are staring at you!</i>

115
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:13,541
<i>You feel comfortable?</i>

116
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,750
<i>Actually, I enjoy the attention
I get like this.</i>

117
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
<i>Okay, let's see the result
of our hard work!</i>

118
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:19,916
<i>Come!</i>

119
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:22,541
<i>Goodness.</i>

120
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,166
<i>Could that be a supernatural phenomenon?</i>

121
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,833
<i>Supernatural your ass!</i>

122
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,583
<i>It means you have to do it again!</i>

123
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,833
<i>I'm off to film the others.</i>

124
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,291
<i>You guys keep flirting with each other.</i>

125
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:35,750
<i>You haven't interviewed me yet!</i>

126
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,083
<i>No one wants to interview you!</i>

127
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:38,750
<i>Or you can interview her!</i>

128
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:41,583
-Come interview me.
-No!

129
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:44,458
-So annoying!
-Stop messing around!

130
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,333
I forgot to start streaming.

131
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,708
TUNG HU NATIONAL UNIVERSITY, LIVE START

132
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:52,916
{\an8}<i>Hello, juniors.</i>

133
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,791
{\an8}<i>I'm Hsin-chiao,
a postgraduate in the student union.</i>

134
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,416
{\an8}<i>The test of courage
will take place tomorrow.</i>

135
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,666
Let's check what the captain
and the duty officer are doing.

136
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,583
{\an8}<i>Let's go!</i>

137
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:05,125
{\an8}<i>Shall we change a place?</i>

138
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,416
{\an8}<i>It's too dangerous to do it
on the Female Ghost Bridge.</i>

139
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,125
{\an8}<i>Why didn't you say it earlier?</i>

140
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,083
{\an8}<i>Well, we can still change it.</i>

141
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:12,375
{\an8}<i>Of course not.</i>

142
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,958
{\an8}<i>You know very few people
have signed up for this event.</i>

143
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,458
{\an8}<i>But so many joined the test of courage</i>

144
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,041
{\an8}<i>held at Chinese Culture University.</i>

145
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:20,458
{\an8}<i>They did it before us.</i>

146
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,666
{\an8}<i>We must get more people!</i>

147
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,333
{\an8}<i>Are you stupid or something?</i>

148
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:25,833
{\an8}<i>Safety comes first!</i>

149
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,958
{\an8}<i>You didn't bring it up back then.
Everything is ready.</i>

150
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,416
{\an8}<i>Are all law students as stupid as you?</i>

151
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,666
{\an8}<i>Me?</i>

152
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,583
{\an8}<i>Te-chuan, look at her!</i>

153
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:38,666
{\an8}<i>So mean!</i>

154
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,250
{\an8}<i>This is the captain, Meng Po-ju.</i>

155
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:42,583
{\an8}<i>We call her "San-nu."</i>

156
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:45,583
What is this?

157
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,250
Chi Te-chuan.

158
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,416
You're so out of the loop!

159
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,750
I'm doing livestreaming.

160
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:52,666
{\an8}<i>So what should I say?</i>

161
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:54,333
{\an8}<i>Don't be harsh on him.</i>

162
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:55,666
{\an8}<i>Then say something on his behalf.</i>

163
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,666
I'll do it.

164
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,583
{\an8}This is Te-chuan, a third-year student
in Mass Communication.

165
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,208
{\an8}<i>He's the duty officer this year.</i>

166
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:04,458
{\an8}<i>His favorite pastime</i>

167
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,041
{\an8}<i>is scaring girls!</i>

168
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,166
That's why the test of courage
is being held

169
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,500
on the Female Ghost Bridge.

170
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:10,958
I didn't choose the place.

171
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,166
It has nothing to do with me.

172
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:13,666
{\an8}<i>So who chose the goddamn place?</i>

173
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:15,875
{\an8}<i>Well, it's you.</i>

174
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:17,500
{\an8}<i>No, I remember it was--</i>

175
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,333
{\an8}<i>No need to discuss something like this.</i>

176
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,041
{\an8}<i>Let's go check if everything is ready
for tonight. Let's go!</i>

177
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:25,083
Well, I'm really curious
about who chose the place.

178
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,583
-You're so annoying.
-It's really haunted.

179
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,375
-So scary!
-It's not scary.

180
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:30,750
{\an8}<i>You're the scary one. The scariest.</i>

181
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:31,791
{\an8}<i>I'm scary?</i>

182
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,125
{\an8}<i>You had better...</i>

183
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:34,250
{\an8}<i>Wait.</i>

184
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:37,208
{\an8}<i>What?</i>

185
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,500
{\an8}<i>Please stop filming.</i>

186
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,000
TUNG HU NATIONAL UNIVERSITY, LIVE END

187
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:43,375
{\an8}<i>Do you have to be like this?</i>

188
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,458
{\an8}<i>Can't we talk nicely to each other?</i>

189
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:49,541
{\an8}<i>I've said everything I needed to say.</i>

190
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,958
{\an8}<i>Just look after yourself.</i>

191
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,125
{\an8}<i>You still won't come back to me?</i>

192
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,458
{\an8}<i>I'm giving you one more chance.</i>

193
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,208
{\an8}<i>Would you stop making a scene?</i>

194
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:00,833
{\an8}<i>What are you guys doing?</i>

195
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,833
{\an8}<i>Nothing. It's all set.</i>

196
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:05,625
{\an8}<i>-Te-chuan, it's dark here!
-Okay.</i>

197
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,708
{\an8}<i>Go to hell then.</i>

198
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,625
{\an8}<i>We agreed not to show my face.</i>

199
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,166
{\an8}<i>Stop filming.</i>

200
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:20,791
Don't make me lose my job

201
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,125
for so little money.

202
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:24,750
I'm sorry.

203
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:25,750
We have stopped filming.

204
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,833
You guys are so bothersome.

205
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:29,083
{\an8}Are you sure I won't be seen?

206
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,000
<i>I promise.</i>

207
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,125
<i>You can talk now.</i>

208
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,708
{\an8}<i>A group of students met with an accident.</i>

209
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,083
{\an8}They committed suicide
in very strange places.

210
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,583
All in different places?

211
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,541
That's what they told the public.

212
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:43,916
The creepiest thing is

213
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,541
they all drowned.

214
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,458
The bridge and the dorm

215
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:49,041
were cordoned off years ago.

216
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,333
But those bloody kids
just wouldn't listen.

217
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:05,750
<i>What do you think?</i>

218
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:07,708
<i>Scary, right? Come here.</i>

219
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,791
<i>Put this on and hide behind the tree.</i>

220
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,541
<i>When you hear my cue, you dart out.</i>

221
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:14,291
<i>Why don't you put it on
and wait for my cue?</i>

222
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:15,708
<i>Because you look scarier!</i>

223
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,125
<i>What the hell? Do I look scary?</i>

224
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,125
<i>You're the scary one.</i>

225
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,416
<i>Even ghosts will be scared!</i>

226
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,250
<i>I wasn't that mean, was I?</i>

227
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:28,875
<i>I didn't mean it.</i>

228
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:30,625
<i>Don't be angry.</i>

229
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:34,125
<i>If I become a ghost,
you're the first on my list!</i>

230
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,000
<i>Why don't I turn you into one now?</i>

231
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,583
<i>Don't hit so hard! Are you serious?</i>

232
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:40,625
<i>Are you guys ready?</i>

233
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:42,750
-I'm going to film the others.
-Okay.

234
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,166
We just need to adjust it a bit.

235
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,041
<i>Come on, hurry up!</i>

236
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,250
What are you doing?

237
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,750
-Have you started streaming?
-Not yet.

238
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,541
I'm testing the light.

239
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,708
So I'll leave the filming

240
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:25,083
to you two mass communication students!

241
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:28,000
I'll shoot behind-the-scenes footage
with this camera.

242
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,583
Come on, sit down.
I can't start shooting until you sit.

243
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,083
I don't want to sit here!

244
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:34,458
Goodness, just sit down.

245
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:36,500
We're all here. No need to be scared.

246
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,291
I'll protect you if anything happens.

247
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:39,791
It's almost midnight.

248
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm about to start streaming.

249
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,500
You guys at the back! Ready?

250
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:43,625
-Yes, ready!
-Yes, ready!

251
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:46,166
I'm the one left here.
You just don't care about how I feel!

252
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:49,125
Aren't you an IT student?
Why are you afraid of ghosts?

253
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,750
You know, according to quantum mechanics,

254
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,041
ghosts do exist!

255
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,500
We study liberal arts.
I don't understand a word you're saying.

256
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,333
-What?
-Hold it.

257
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,750
Damn! Why do you blindfold me?

258
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,958
Are you playing tricks on me
or the juniors?

259
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,083
We have to do it for real.

260
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,708
You remember the rundown?

261
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,166
No, I don't!

262
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,833
We'll start streaming on the bridge!

263
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,375
The bell tied to the chair is your cue.

264
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,500
You just take off the blindfold
and walk up the bridge.

265
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:21,208
Remember, don't count the steps!

266
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,791
When we are done, go back to Room 414!

267
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,916
Why is it taking so long?

268
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,916
Are we starting yet?

269
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:49,958
Stop messing around.

270
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,041
{\an8}<i>Attention please, juniors.</i>

271
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:58,833
{\an8}<i>This year, the test of courage</i>

272
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,208
{\an8}<i>is held at the forbidden spot
in Tung Hu University,</i>

273
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,958
{\an8}<i>the Female Ghost Bridge.</i>

274
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,666
{\an8}<i>You guys will be starting from here.</i>

275
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,166
{\an8}<i>When you hear the bell,</i>

276
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,458
{\an8}<i>take off the red cloth</i>

277
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:09,958
{\an8}<i>and circle around the lake.</i>

278
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,000
Go.

279
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,250
Please do remember.

280
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:34,916
No matter what happens,

281
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:37,458
never turn your head on the stairs.

282
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:45,333
{\an8}One, two, three, four...

283
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,708
{\an8}-What is he doing?
-Six.

284
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,208
Did someone ask him to count the steps?

285
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:50,791
{\an8}Didn't we agree not to count?

286
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,000
{\an8}<i>Let him count.</i>

287
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,375
{\an8}<i>It's more exciting.</i>

288
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,750
No, we can't do that. Wen-yao!

289
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,291
Wen-yao, stop counting! Wen-yao!

290
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,666
-Wen-yao!
-Eleven.

291
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,791
-Wen-yao!
-Wen-yao, stop counting!

292
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:04,041
{\an8}-Fourteen.
-Wen-yao!

293
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,125
{\an8}<i>There really are 14 steps.</i>

294
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,166
Who did that?

295
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:20,541
Aren't we all right here?

296
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,625
Where has he gone to?

297
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,250
Where is Wen-yao?

298
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,500
You guys are so damn childish!

299
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:40,416
Wait.

300
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,291
Did we just turn around on the steps?

301
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:47,625
-It doesn't count, does it?
-No.

302
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:48,708
Did you do that too?

303
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,083
It wasn't me.

304
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,833
{\an8}Let's go!

305
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,250
You tried to trick me?

306
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,916
I'll scare you bastards to death!

307
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:22,875
TE-CHUAN: THE CHAIR WAS A GOOD TRICK

308
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:24,416
REMEMBER TO PACK UP THE CAMERA

309
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,208
What chair?

310
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,541
That doesn't count
as turning my head, right?

311
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,500
Forget about the camera.

312
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:00,291
<i>Yes?</i>

313
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,708
Turn the screen to the brightest.

314
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:06,250
<i>Yes, this is as bright as it gets.</i>

315
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,208
Why is it getting dimmer?

316
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:17,666
Turn the screen to the brightest!

317
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,416
Turn the screen to the brightest.

318
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:25,625
<i>This is as bright as it gets.</i>

319
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:31,333
<i>This is as bright as it gets.</i>

320
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,958
-What the hell?
<i>-This is as bright as it gets.</i>

321
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,166
Turn the flashlight on.

322
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:37,666
<i>It's on.</i>

323
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,500
Shit.

324
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:44,166
I thought there was someone.

325
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,041
I'm here.

326
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,625
What on earth happened just now?
Was that you?

327
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:05,708
No, it wasn't me!

328
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,541
So why did we start running then?

329
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,666
Someone started running
and the rest just followed suit!

330
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,958
What the hell is going on?

331
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:14,583
Calm down, okay?

332
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,791
Didn't we say we would go back
to the dorm first?

333
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,458
Let's go back to the dorm first.

334
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,916
Wen-yao didn't reply to my text.

335
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,416
Should we go look for him?

336
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,791
You and Wen-yao played a trick on us.
Didn't you?

337
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:33,125
I won't admit it without any evidence.

338
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,666
I can smell crime.

339
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,208
So what are you?

340
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,958
A judge or psychic?

341
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:44,583
Here is the evidence!

342
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,708
In that case,
I've snatched the evidence back!

343
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:50,833
Silly you!

344
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,250
Put me down or they will see us.

345
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:55,000
We'll make it public then.

346
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,125
But we're just having a fling.

347
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:01,000
That really hurts.

348
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,625
I'm doing it for your sake, all right?

349
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,916
I know.

350
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,875
Besides, if she hears about it,

351
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,458
it will be hard for you to deal with it.

352
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,708
Don't you worry about that.

353
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,458
I didn't break up with her properly.

354
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,041
I'm sorry.

355
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,291
I'm happy as long as
we can see each other.

356
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,958
I'm only happy when I'm with you.

357
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:42,791
All right.

358
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,208
Let's go look for Wen-yao.

359
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:48,375
He's not replying to my text at all.

360
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:49,875
So annoying!

361
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,291
Where are the others?

362
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,708
Why did we bother
to hold the test of courage on the bridge?

363
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,541
I'm going to karaoke later.

364
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:06,541
It's so late!

365
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:08,291
We have an event tomorrow morning.

366
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,416
I don't understand why we were assigned
to a deserted dorm.

367
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,291
It's so spooky here!

368
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:16,458
Don't be scared.
I'll be back soon to keep you safe.

369
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,791
Okay.

370
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:21,000
I'm going to the restroom.
Wait until I get back.

371
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,416
It's all right.

372
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:35,291
<i>Wen-yao!</i>

373
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,083
<i>Wen-yao!</i>

374
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,958
<i>Where has he gone?</i>

375
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,083
It has already had more than 10,000 views!

376
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,208
Why are there so many views?

377
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,458
What does this comment mean?

378
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:47,416
"They even showed the ghost
in the advertisement."

379
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,625
Wait.

380
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,875
-That's it, isn't it?
-Let me see.

381
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:58,125
HSIN-CHIAO: ARE YOU SEEING SAN-NU?

382
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:00,416
It's just a smudge on the screen.

383
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,083
Is it Wen-yao?

384
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:04,333
No.

385
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:06,458
They're asking if we have found Wen-yao.

386
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,041
He hasn't gone back to the dorm?

387
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,208
DON'T THINK TOO MUCH

388
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:13,125
No, I don't think so.

389
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:14,125
WE'LL TALK AFTER THE EVENT

390
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,541
It's so late. Where did he go?

391
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:38,166
I'm the only friend you have.

392
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,291
Who are you chatting with?

393
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,666
Bullshit.

394
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,791
I've got tons of friends, okay?

395
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:47,416
Then why did you follow me
to Tung Hu University?

396
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:52,250
You could have gone to a better one.

397
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,958
Give it back to me!

398
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:58,583
Just tell me you're talking to Sung.

399
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:01,416
I'm just wondering
why he has been gone so long.

400
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,041
I was only asking.

401
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:04,833
Wait.

402
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:07,875
Something is going on
between you two, right?

403
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:10,208
No, something's going on at the bridge!

404
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:21,958
Who is it?

405
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:23,791
Is it you, Sung?

406
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,500
Who is it?

407
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,833
Go have a look.

408
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:51,458
It's nothing.

409
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,875
It was the wind.

410
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:11,333
Hello?

411
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:16,375
You'll be a bit late?

412
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,666
Okay.

413
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:31,041
Yu-ching?

414
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:35,458
So, Yu-ching cares about me.

415
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,458
Pong!

416
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:58,208
Fifty thousand.

417
00:23:58,375 --> 00:23:59,208
<i>Fifty thousand.</i>

418
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:04,416
No need to choose.

419
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,625
They all stink.

420
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:27,583
Fuck!

421
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:30,000
It's occupied! You hear me?

422
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:12,750
Fuck! What's wrong with you?

423
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:17,333
Damn. Let me see who it is.

424
00:25:30,666 --> 00:25:31,666
Fuck!

425
00:25:31,916 --> 00:25:33,541
Let go of me!

426
00:25:33,625 --> 00:25:34,625
Let go of me! Fuck!

427
00:25:34,708 --> 00:25:35,750
Let go!

428
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:43,791
What the hell?

429
00:26:44,083 --> 00:26:45,750
What the hell?

430
00:27:30,041 --> 00:27:31,666
No.

431
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:39,500
{\an8}<i>"Team Tung Hu put in so much effort."</i>

432
00:29:39,583 --> 00:29:40,875
{\an8}<i>"They went all out."</i>

433
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,916
{\an8}<i>"You can see the ghost even in the promo."</i>

434
00:29:43,458 --> 00:29:45,791
{\an8}<i>"There is a white shadow at the back.
Run, quick!"</i>

435
00:29:46,416 --> 00:29:48,750
{\an8}<i>These were the comments posted
after the livestreaming that day.</i>

436
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:50,791
{\an8}<i>We can see that everyone was crazy</i>

437
00:29:50,875 --> 00:29:53,333
{\an8}<i>about the rumor
of the Female Ghost Bridge.</i>

438
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,583
{\an8}<i>Okay. Cut!</i>

439
00:29:55,583 --> 00:29:57,750
{\an8}<i>What's the point of filming this?
We can do an insert.</i>

440
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:03,791
{\an8}Team B sent us a clip.

441
00:30:03,875 --> 00:30:05,500
{\an8}Didn't they go film the Taoist monk?

442
00:30:08,458 --> 00:30:10,708
<i>Master, what has the accident in 2016</i>

443
00:30:10,791 --> 00:30:12,250
<i>got to do with the Female Ghost Bridge?</i>

444
00:30:18,541 --> 00:30:21,166
<i>The ghost needs to find her replacement.</i>

445
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:24,916
<i>Those who died in the leap year
are forever trapped in hell.</i>

446
00:30:26,666 --> 00:30:27,916
<i>The same tragedy</i>

447
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:29,791
<i>may happen again this year!</i>

448
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:34,791
<i>There are people on the bridge.</i>

449
00:30:37,166 --> 00:30:38,958
<i>The bad vibes are the thickest today.</i>

450
00:30:39,625 --> 00:30:40,958
<i>Another five people will die.</i>

451
00:30:41,833 --> 00:30:43,000
<i>Don't go! Leave now!</i>

452
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,666
So, the rumor of the Female Ghost Bridge

453
00:30:46,791 --> 00:30:47,750
is true?

454
00:30:51,166 --> 00:30:52,750
Let me check the livestream again.

455
00:30:54,583 --> 00:30:56,000
Didn't five students die before?

456
00:30:56,166 --> 00:30:57,333
And it will happen again?

457
00:31:03,458 --> 00:31:04,833
I think I saw something.

458
00:31:04,916 --> 00:31:05,875
Rewind it.

459
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,333
Look!

460
00:31:32,666 --> 00:31:35,250
He didn't even pack up the camera.

461
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,833
Where on earth did Wen-yao go?

462
00:31:47,625 --> 00:31:48,458
I have no idea.

463
00:31:48,541 --> 00:31:49,833
We saw no signs of him

464
00:31:49,916 --> 00:31:51,250
like he was a ghost.

465
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:54,458
Don't say something like that.

466
00:31:54,833 --> 00:31:56,875
What? Don't be so superstitious.

467
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:00,041
Don't take chances at a time like this.

468
00:32:00,708 --> 00:32:01,875
Don't be skeptical.

469
00:32:02,541 --> 00:32:04,875
So you believe in the rumor of the bridge?

470
00:32:05,416 --> 00:32:07,416
Then why did you hold the event here?

471
00:32:09,708 --> 00:32:11,000
I didn't agree with it.

472
00:32:11,625 --> 00:32:12,833
So whose idea is it?

473
00:32:15,625 --> 00:32:17,583
I think Wen-yao must have gone back.

474
00:32:19,416 --> 00:32:21,916
He would send a text if he did.

475
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:23,958
Let me call him.

476
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:07,041
How did this happen?

477
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:12,208
Should we check the CCTV footage
at the security office?

478
00:33:14,583 --> 00:33:15,458
Okay.

479
00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:37,666
{\an8}<i>Come in. Don't let others see you.</i>

480
00:33:40,583 --> 00:33:42,291
{\an8}<i>I'm not sure if the file is still intact.</i>

481
00:33:43,541 --> 00:33:45,583
{\an8}<i>No records before year 2012 were saved.</i>

482
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,500
<i>Find it yourself.</i>

483
00:33:47,583 --> 00:33:48,708
<i>Be quick.</i>

484
00:33:56,083 --> 00:33:57,666
<i>"Men's Dorm 11."</i>

485
00:34:00,458 --> 00:34:01,916
<i>Year 2012.</i>

486
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:05,500
{\an8}<i>Year 2013, 2014, 2015.</i>

487
00:34:05,791 --> 00:34:07,416
{\an8}<i>Year 2016, here it is.</i>

488
00:34:08,208 --> 00:34:11,125
<i>February.</i>

489
00:34:11,375 --> 00:34:14,333
<i>February 28.</i>

490
00:34:14,416 --> 00:34:15,666
<i>I've got it.</i>

491
00:34:17,041 --> 00:34:18,958
<i>One, two.</i>

492
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:21,750
<i>Three.</i>

493
00:34:22,541 --> 00:34:23,416
<i>Four.</i>

494
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,333
<i>Five.</i>

495
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:27,083
{\an8}<i>These must be the five students
that died in the accident.</i>

496
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:34,875
It's the footage of them
returning to the dorm.

497
00:34:39,833 --> 00:34:41,083
Check which room they stayed in.

498
00:34:41,208 --> 00:34:42,125
Okay.

499
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,250
Hello?

500
00:34:46,958 --> 00:34:48,166
The papers are here?

501
00:34:48,666 --> 00:34:49,833
I'll send someone to get them.

502
00:34:50,916 --> 00:34:53,416
I need to copy the files. Go pick
something up for me at the front gate.

503
00:34:53,666 --> 00:34:54,583
Right.

504
00:34:55,041 --> 00:34:55,916
Okay.

505
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,500
There is no one here.

506
00:35:28,666 --> 00:35:30,125
I guess they're patrolling the campus.

507
00:35:32,166 --> 00:35:34,833
Should we just check
the monitor ourselves?

508
00:35:34,916 --> 00:35:36,833
That's illegal.

509
00:35:37,083 --> 00:35:38,458
You can keep watch.

510
00:35:39,875 --> 00:35:41,833
Why should I be your accomplice?

511
00:35:42,041 --> 00:35:44,125
We don't know when the guards
will be back.

512
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:45,625
If anything happens to Wen-yao,

513
00:35:45,708 --> 00:35:47,583
won't we be charged with manslaughter?

514
00:35:47,666 --> 00:35:48,958
Manslaughter?

515
00:35:49,041 --> 00:35:49,958
So persuasive.

516
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:51,500
That's why you fell for me.

517
00:35:52,333 --> 00:35:54,750
We don't know who fell for whom yet, okay?

518
00:36:02,708 --> 00:36:04,416
Sung didn't answer the call?

519
00:36:04,625 --> 00:36:05,916
It didn't go through.

520
00:36:09,791 --> 00:36:10,875
Miss.

521
00:36:11,083 --> 00:36:13,333
Can you stop pacing back and forth?

522
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:20,166
Then come to the restroom with me.

523
00:36:23,625 --> 00:36:25,000
Okay.

524
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:26,208
Let's go.

525
00:36:30,875 --> 00:36:31,916
<i>Look over here.</i>

526
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:33,458
<i>What are you doing?</i>

527
00:36:34,333 --> 00:36:36,208
<i>Usually, I'm the one who gets scared.</i>

528
00:36:36,291 --> 00:36:37,708
<i>Now it's your turn.</i>

529
00:36:38,833 --> 00:36:40,291
<i>Beg me.</i>

530
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:42,250
<i>Whatever!</i>

531
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,625
<i>Just hurry up.</i>

532
00:36:46,541 --> 00:36:48,000
Where are you going?

533
00:36:48,083 --> 00:36:49,125
The restroom is over there.

534
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:51,916
<i>Sung is there.
I want to go to the other side.</i>

535
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:54,250
Are you sure you don't want to run?

536
00:36:54,583 --> 00:36:56,583
No. It will leak if I run fast.

537
00:36:57,458 --> 00:36:58,541
This is as fast as I can go.

538
00:37:01,666 --> 00:37:02,791
Stop laughing!

539
00:37:02,875 --> 00:37:04,125
I can't hold it if I laugh!

540
00:37:10,791 --> 00:37:12,583
Yu-ching, come on!

541
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:31,458
See? You wanted to pee too, right?

542
00:37:35,375 --> 00:37:36,416
You're not filming, are you?

543
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:38,041
Yu-ching.

544
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:40,250
Yu-ching?

545
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,583
<i>Why did you come from the outside?</i>

546
00:38:07,125 --> 00:38:08,416
<i>Were you not in the restroom too?</i>

547
00:38:09,833 --> 00:38:10,916
<i>No, I wasn't.</i>

548
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:12,666
<i>Are you done?</i>

549
00:38:20,625 --> 00:38:21,583
<i>What?</i>

550
00:38:23,625 --> 00:38:24,875
Someone is in there.

551
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:34,375
<i>What are you doing?</i>

552
00:38:35,333 --> 00:38:36,916
Let me check.

553
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:39,791
Otherwise, no one
will be able to sleep tonight.

554
00:38:41,291 --> 00:38:43,625
-No, don't.
-It's fine.

555
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,750
I scared you, didn't I?

556
00:39:23,416 --> 00:39:25,125
Don't be such a pain in the neck!

557
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:27,000
Go to your beloved Sung!

558
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,833
Chao Hsin-chiao, wait for me!

559
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:35,791
Why did it get so dirty?

560
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:38,000
Hsin-chiao!

561
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,083
Hsin-chiao, wait for me!

562
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:46,416
Hsin-chiao!

563
00:39:46,916 --> 00:39:48,000
<i>Ghosts that haunt colleges.</i>

564
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:49,083
<i>There are lots of ghost stories</i>

565
00:39:49,166 --> 00:39:50,708
<i>of the Daren Building
at Chinese Culture University, right?</i>

566
00:39:50,833 --> 00:39:53,708
<i>The building was built in the shape
of an upside-down</i> Bagua.

567
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:55,041
<i>It's a perfect place for ghosts.</i>

568
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:56,833
<i>The haunted elevator
is the best-known story.</i>

569
00:39:56,916 --> 00:39:58,083
<i>Haunted elevator?</i>

570
00:39:58,166 --> 00:40:00,541
<i>Yes, a teacher went to check.</i>

571
00:40:00,625 --> 00:40:01,750
<i>He pressed the first floor,</i>

572
00:40:01,833 --> 00:40:03,208
<i>but the elevator didn't stop.</i>

573
00:40:03,291 --> 00:40:05,458
<i>It kept going down and never came back up.</i>

574
00:40:05,541 --> 00:40:08,041
That story about
Chinese Culture University is so scary.

575
00:40:08,458 --> 00:40:11,041
The story of the Female Ghost Bridge
is scarier.

576
00:40:11,125 --> 00:40:13,500
What exactly happened on the bridge?

577
00:40:13,833 --> 00:40:16,208
Didn't she drown herself in the lake?

578
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:18,541
Not at all.

579
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:19,916
It's not true.

580
00:40:20,375 --> 00:40:21,833
<i>So what really happened?</i>

581
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:27,208
<i>One year,</i>

582
00:40:27,416 --> 00:40:30,625
<i>a female student decided to elope
with her boyfriend.</i>

583
00:40:30,958 --> 00:40:32,416
<i>They agreed to meet on the bridge.</i>

584
00:40:33,541 --> 00:40:36,041
<i>The girl kept waiting till midnight,</i>

585
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:38,166
<i>but there was no sight of her boyfriend.</i>

586
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:42,458
<i>At that moment,
someone appeared on the steps</i>

587
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:44,000
<i>and waved at her.</i>

588
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:47,958
<i>Just as she stepped on the 13th step,</i>

589
00:40:48,875 --> 00:40:52,875
<i>she was dragged into the woods
and raped by five men.</i>

590
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,375
<i>No matter how she struggled
and begged them,</i>

591
00:40:55,708 --> 00:40:58,333
<i>they refused to let her go.</i>

592
00:40:58,875 --> 00:40:59,833
<i>In the end,</i>

593
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:01,791
<i>she was pushed into the lake and drowned.</i>

594
00:41:03,416 --> 00:41:04,791
<i>Ever since then,</i>

595
00:41:05,083 --> 00:41:06,541
<i>every day at midnight,</i>

596
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:09,291
<i>an extra step would appear</i>

597
00:41:09,541 --> 00:41:10,833
<i>on the 13-step bridge.</i>

598
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:12,875
<i>At that moment,</i>

599
00:41:12,958 --> 00:41:15,958
<i>-never turn your head around.</i>
-Twelve, thirteen.

600
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:17,083
<i>If you do,</i>

601
00:41:17,666 --> 00:41:18,708
<i>the ghost</i>

602
00:41:18,791 --> 00:41:20,250
<i>-will be right in front of you.</i>
-Fourteen.

603
00:41:21,875 --> 00:41:24,083
You're so mean!

604
00:41:24,166 --> 00:41:25,791
Why are you being so serious?

605
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:27,625
If you dump me like the guy in the story,

606
00:41:27,708 --> 00:41:29,208
I won't wait for you on the bridge.

607
00:41:29,583 --> 00:41:30,833
Don't wait for me.

608
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,875
You had better go reincarnate.

609
00:41:33,916 --> 00:41:35,750
You're finished!
I'll strangle you to death!

610
00:41:36,041 --> 00:41:38,833
Okay, I surrender!

611
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,208
Seems like someone else is here.

612
00:41:44,416 --> 00:41:45,625
There's nothing.

613
00:41:45,916 --> 00:41:47,125
Yes, right...

614
00:41:48,583 --> 00:41:50,166
That's weird.

615
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:54,875
{\an8}Didn't you see it?

616
00:41:55,083 --> 00:41:56,166
The head is moving.

617
00:41:56,458 --> 00:41:57,375
{\an8}What head?

618
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,125
There is something.

619
00:42:07,708 --> 00:42:08,708
What?

620
00:42:13,541 --> 00:42:15,125
I saw something.

621
00:42:16,666 --> 00:42:19,208
But there shouldn't be anyone
at this time.

622
00:42:20,625 --> 00:42:21,750
It must be Wen-yao.

623
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,666
Let's go to the makeup classroom.

624
00:42:26,041 --> 00:42:26,916
Let's go.

625
00:42:28,083 --> 00:42:29,000
Come on.

626
00:42:35,875 --> 00:42:38,083
Why is it taking so long to wash it off?

627
00:42:38,583 --> 00:42:40,666
Was I being too much?

628
00:42:41,541 --> 00:42:42,458
Hsin-chiao!

629
00:42:42,541 --> 00:42:43,958
Wait for me!

630
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,583
What the hell?

631
00:42:55,166 --> 00:42:56,958
Help...

632
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,041
Sung?

633
00:43:08,291 --> 00:43:09,416
Is that you?

634
00:43:27,083 --> 00:43:28,833
What are you doing?

635
00:43:29,541 --> 00:43:31,333
What are you doing?

636
00:43:33,916 --> 00:43:35,458
What happened to you?

637
00:44:01,333 --> 00:44:02,875
<i>The doors are closing.</i>

638
00:44:06,875 --> 00:44:08,541
What on earth is Wen-yao doing?

639
00:44:13,416 --> 00:44:15,333
<i>I wonder what the others are up to.</i>

640
00:44:19,875 --> 00:44:20,833
Te-chuan.

641
00:44:21,541 --> 00:44:22,666
This is B1.

642
00:44:24,166 --> 00:44:25,541
Didn't we press the fourth floor?

643
00:44:25,625 --> 00:44:26,666
What's going on?

644
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:30,000
<i>The doors are closing.</i>

645
00:44:46,375 --> 00:44:47,916
Why isn't it going up?

646
00:45:01,791 --> 00:45:03,333
San-nu.

647
00:45:03,708 --> 00:45:04,791
What's wrong?

648
00:45:06,666 --> 00:45:08,708
There really was something in there.

649
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:11,708
There's nothing.

650
00:45:12,666 --> 00:45:14,125
Why don't you believe me?

651
00:45:14,291 --> 00:45:15,916
I do. It's...

652
00:45:16,875 --> 00:45:19,583
Don't be scared.
I'll protect you if anything happens.

653
00:45:20,708 --> 00:45:21,916
Can we go back?

654
00:45:23,708 --> 00:45:25,708
We'll go back as soon as
we find Wen-yao, okay?

655
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,958
-Let's go.
-Okay.

656
00:45:55,166 --> 00:45:56,875
<i>This is Room 414.</i>

657
00:45:56,958 --> 00:45:59,625
{\an8}<i>When the incident happened,
five students had spent the night here.</i>

658
00:45:59,708 --> 00:46:00,625
<i>At--</i>

659
00:46:01,916 --> 00:46:02,833
<i>What's wrong?</i>

660
00:46:04,708 --> 00:46:05,833
I'm not feeling well.

661
00:46:05,916 --> 00:46:06,875
It smells in there.

662
00:46:19,375 --> 00:46:20,750
Damn you, Yu-ching.

663
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:32,625
Did you have to be so annoying?

664
00:47:25,208 --> 00:47:26,375
You're still hiding?

665
00:47:53,291 --> 00:47:54,333
What are you doing?

666
00:48:35,416 --> 00:48:36,291
Who's there?

667
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:18,583
Hsin-chiao!

668
00:50:21,875 --> 00:50:25,000
Hsin-chiao!

669
00:50:25,625 --> 00:50:27,958
Hsin-chiao!

670
00:50:28,916 --> 00:50:30,333
Hsin-chiao!

671
00:50:30,416 --> 00:50:32,250
Hsin-chiao!

672
00:50:33,958 --> 00:50:36,458
No, not that way!

673
00:51:05,083 --> 00:51:06,416
Strange.

674
00:51:06,583 --> 00:51:08,166
Why did Wen-yao go back to the classroom?

675
00:51:32,875 --> 00:51:33,833
Wen-yao.

676
00:51:35,416 --> 00:51:36,375
Wen-yao.

677
00:51:39,916 --> 00:51:42,333
Don't go in there.

678
00:51:44,916 --> 00:51:46,583
Wait for me here.

679
00:51:46,875 --> 00:51:47,916
Let me turn on the lights.

680
00:51:48,416 --> 00:51:49,458
I'll go check.

681
00:51:57,916 --> 00:51:59,000
It's not working.

682
00:51:59,083 --> 00:52:01,041
Let me check the back for another switch.

683
00:52:01,291 --> 00:52:02,333
Be quick!

684
00:52:10,125 --> 00:52:11,125
Wen-yao.

685
00:52:30,291 --> 00:52:31,250
Wen-yao!

686
00:52:32,958 --> 00:52:33,958
Te-chuan...

687
00:52:35,333 --> 00:52:36,291
Wen-yao.

688
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
San-nu.

689
00:52:41,166 --> 00:52:43,041
Wen-yao! Where are you going?

690
00:52:44,666 --> 00:52:46,541
Te-chuan, where are you?

691
00:53:11,208 --> 00:53:12,333
Te-chuan.

692
00:53:14,583 --> 00:53:15,625
Te-chuan.

693
00:53:17,708 --> 00:53:19,333
Come out now, Te-chuan.

694
00:53:24,708 --> 00:53:25,625
Te-chuan.

695
00:53:25,916 --> 00:53:27,166
Stop messing around!

696
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:37,500
Te-chuan, you're over there, right?

697
00:53:51,416 --> 00:53:52,333
Te-chuan!

698
00:53:53,125 --> 00:53:54,250
Stop messing around!

699
00:53:55,416 --> 00:53:56,541
It's not funny!

700
00:54:40,208 --> 00:54:42,750
Te-chuan!

701
00:55:26,583 --> 00:55:27,500
San-nu!

702
00:55:29,541 --> 00:55:30,666
Go!

703
00:55:39,958 --> 00:55:41,916
Call someone!

704
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:44,541
There is no signal.

705
00:55:59,708 --> 00:56:01,541
Quick!

706
00:56:06,875 --> 00:56:09,833
Quick!

707
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:15,000
Wait.

708
00:56:15,416 --> 00:56:16,833
Why did you stop?

709
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:19,625
Don't you find it strange?

710
00:56:20,291 --> 00:56:21,833
We've been going down so many floors.

711
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:32,833
I don't care! I just want to get out!

712
00:56:33,833 --> 00:56:34,666
Yu-ching!

713
00:56:39,875 --> 00:56:42,333
Get up.

714
00:56:54,625 --> 00:56:56,291
How did we end up here?

715
00:56:57,083 --> 00:56:59,958
We're doomed.

716
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,041
Yes, we're doomed!

717
00:57:06,958 --> 00:57:08,041
Don't worry.

718
00:57:08,375 --> 00:57:09,958
We'll find a way down.

719
00:57:28,916 --> 00:57:30,333
Shih Yu-ching!

720
00:57:31,125 --> 00:57:32,708
Pull yourself together!

721
00:57:33,875 --> 00:57:35,541
I'll protect you.

722
00:57:37,208 --> 00:57:39,500
We shouldn't have played the game.

723
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:41,583
We won't be able to get away.

724
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:43,000
We can't escape.

725
00:57:53,541 --> 00:57:55,625
I don't want to die.

726
00:57:57,416 --> 00:57:59,375
I don't want to die.

727
00:57:59,458 --> 00:58:02,416
-There must be a way.
-I don't want to die.

728
00:58:02,583 --> 00:58:06,125
I don't want to die.

729
00:58:08,083 --> 00:58:10,708
I don't want to die.

730
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:17,625
Yu-ching, get up!

731
00:58:17,708 --> 00:58:19,125
I don't want to die.

732
00:58:20,208 --> 00:58:21,166

{\an8}<i>It's the office of those students
who had died.</i>

736
00:59:56,291 --> 00:59:58,000
{\an8}<i>See what you can find.
I'll check the files.</i>

{\an8}<i>It has been four years.</i>

{\an8}<i>What clues do you expect to find?</i>

739
01:00:05,791 --> 01:00:07,250
{\an8}<i>Check every nook and cranny.</i>

740

How did you get the statement
from the police?

743
01:00:17,041 --> 01:00:18,625
It's better if you don't know.

Only five were reported in the news too.

Wait.

Why are we walking towards the bridge?

Yu-ching!

777
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,041
Is that you?

778
01:04:22,833 --> 01:04:24,375
What are you doing here?

779
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:35,250
Didn't you say you'd protect me?

Didn't you say you'd protect me?

Yes.

782
01:04:45,333 --> 01:04:47,791
I said I'd protect you.

783

Didn't you say

784

you'd protect me?

{\an8}<i>We could check and find out

Why aren't the others such as
Meng Po-ju or Li Wen-yao in here?

803
01:07:21,625 --> 01:07:23,375
Who are these five people

807
01:07:38,708 --> 01:07:40,000
I must have missed something.

808
01:07:41,375 --> 01:07:43,375
You mean something happened

809
01:07:43,833 --> 01:07:45,000
in 2012 as well?

810
01:07:45,625 --> 01:07:48,541
Didn't the test of courage on
the Female Ghost Bridge go wrong in 2016?

811
01:07:48,625 --> 01:07:50,250
So it was stopped after that.

812
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:53,583
I remember a strange article on BBS.

813
01:07:53,791 --> 01:07:54,791
Maybe you should look it up.

814
01:07:55,708 --> 01:07:58,750
FEMALE GHOST BRIDGE, TUNG HU UNIVERSITY

815
01:08:01,166 --> 01:08:03,375
"Five people died on the bridge.

816
01:08:03,583 --> 01:08:04,791
A news blackout was imposed.

817
01:08:04,875 --> 01:08:06,333
It wasn't reported."

818
01:08:07,458 --> 01:08:09,041
But there wasn't a news blackout.

819
01:08:15,208 --> 01:08:16,625
This was posted in 2012.

820
01:08:25,750 --> 01:08:27,708
On the same date in 2012,

821
01:08:27,875 --> 01:08:29,791
a test of courage was held
on the bridge too.

822
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,166
You guys keep flirting with each other.

823
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:35,666
You haven't interviewed me!

824
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:37,000
No one wants to interview you!

825
01:08:37,083 --> 01:08:38,500
Or you can interview her.

826
01:08:38,583 --> 01:08:40,375
-Come interview me.
-No!

827
01:08:40,458 --> 01:08:42,708
-So annoying!
-Stop messing around!

828
01:08:43,208 --> 01:08:44,166
Hello?

829
01:08:44,333 --> 01:08:45,625
Where are you?

830
01:08:46,458 --> 01:08:47,666
I forgot to start streaming.

831
01:08:47,833 --> 01:08:49,041
FEBRUARY 28, 2016

832
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:50,041
Hello, juniors.

833
01:08:50,125 --> 01:08:52,541
I'm Hsin-chiao,
a postgraduate in the student union.

834
01:08:52,625 --> 01:08:54,166
The test of courage
will take place tomorrow.

835
01:08:55,208 --> 01:08:58,166
Let's check what the captain
and the duty officer are doing.

836
01:08:58,250 --> 01:08:59,208
Let's go!

837
01:09:00,083 --> 01:09:01,541
I'm going to film the others.

838
01:09:01,625 --> 01:09:03,000
Okay. We just need to adjust it a bit.

839
01:09:03,083 --> 01:09:05,083
Hurry up! You're so slow.

840
01:09:05,375 --> 01:09:09,833
FEBRUARY 28, 2012

841
01:09:12,083 --> 01:09:13,125
What are you doing?

842
01:09:15,208 --> 01:09:16,208
Nothing.

843
01:09:16,375 --> 01:09:18,083
We are ready. Come on.

844
01:09:19,458 --> 01:09:20,291
Hurry up!

845
01:09:20,375 --> 01:09:21,458
It's almost midnight.

846
01:09:22,916 --> 01:09:24,125
You guys hurry up!

847
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:25,458
Okay.

848
01:09:26,541 --> 01:09:28,125
-Have you started streaming?
-Not yet.

849
01:09:28,208 --> 01:09:29,750
I'm testing the light.

850
01:09:29,916 --> 01:09:33,250
FEBRUARY 28, 2016

851
01:09:33,875 --> 01:09:35,500
You guys at the back! Ready?

852
01:09:36,083 --> 01:09:37,250
-Yes, ready!
-Yes, ready!

853
01:09:37,333 --> 01:09:39,833
I'm the one left here.
You just don't care about how I feel!

854
01:09:40,750 --> 01:09:42,708
Aren't you an IT student?
Why are you afraid of ghosts?

855
01:09:47,083 --> 01:09:49,708
What happened to the students in 2012?

856
01:09:57,208 --> 01:09:58,125
Hsin-chiao!

857
01:09:58,208 --> 01:09:59,500
Shih Yu-ching!

858
01:09:59,583 --> 01:10:01,000
Pull yourself together!

859
01:10:01,583 --> 01:10:02,916
I'll protect you.

860
01:10:09,791 --> 01:10:10,958
I'm sorry.

861
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:14,375
Chao Hsin-chiao survived.

862
01:10:15,791 --> 01:10:18,083
Four years later,
she took part in the event again.

863
01:10:18,958 --> 01:10:20,208
Another four people died.

864
01:10:22,375 --> 01:10:23,750
What sort of person was she?

865
01:10:23,833 --> 01:10:25,375
What on earth did she experience

866
01:10:25,583 --> 01:10:26,791
that brought her back again?

867
01:10:28,125 --> 01:10:29,458
There must be some connection.

868
01:10:34,625 --> 01:10:36,000
Please, I beg you to spare me.

869
01:10:36,083 --> 01:10:37,083
I'll do anything.

870
01:10:41,458 --> 01:10:43,333
You still won't come back to me?

871
01:10:43,708 --> 01:10:45,000
I'm giving you one more chance.

872
01:10:45,083 --> 01:10:46,166
Would you stop making a scene?

873
01:10:48,333 --> 01:10:49,375
What are you doing?

874
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:51,500
Nothing. Is everything ready?

875
01:10:52,333 --> 01:10:53,666
Go to hell then!

876
01:10:57,375 --> 01:10:58,500
Remember.

877
01:10:58,958 --> 01:11:00,500
No matter what happens,

878
01:11:00,875 --> 01:11:02,666
never turn your head around.

879
01:11:03,416 --> 01:11:04,916
One, two.

880
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,041
What is he doing?

881
01:11:06,208 --> 01:11:07,875
Didn't we agree not to count?

882
01:11:08,458 --> 01:11:09,500
Let him count.

883
01:11:09,833 --> 01:11:11,625
It's more exciting.

884
01:11:12,958 --> 01:11:15,166
Didn't we just turn our heads?

885
01:11:26,375 --> 01:11:27,666
Chao Hsin-chiao!

886
01:11:49,875 --> 01:11:52,750
Why did you choose her over me?

887
01:11:54,083 --> 01:11:56,375
What happened to us
had nothing to do with her!

888
01:11:58,208 --> 01:12:00,666
You're behind all these tricks,
aren't you?

889
01:12:02,583 --> 01:12:04,000
All of you deserve to die!

890
01:12:04,291 --> 01:12:06,250
I gave you a chance.

891
01:12:07,708 --> 01:12:13,500
I thought you would protect me.

892
01:12:15,208 --> 01:12:17,291
I do want to protect you.

893
01:12:18,083 --> 01:12:20,375
But we really aren't meant for each other!

894
01:12:20,708 --> 01:12:22,166
Please, I beg you to let me go!

895
01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:24,416
Let San-nu go, please. I beg you!

896
01:12:52,125 --> 01:12:53,500
Don't hurt San-nu!

897
01:13:19,083 --> 01:13:20,750
Te-chuan.

898
01:13:20,833 --> 01:13:23,000
Help!

899
01:13:26,875 --> 01:13:28,416
San-nu...

900
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:46,000
I'm sorry.

901
01:14:15,875 --> 01:14:17,000
<i>Te-chuan.</i>

902
01:14:17,583 --> 01:14:19,000
<i>Help!</i>

903
01:14:19,291 --> 01:14:21,500
<i>I'm the one left here.
You just don't care about how I feel!</i>

904
01:14:21,583 --> 01:14:23,583
<i>If you dump me like the guy in the story,</i>

905
01:14:23,666 --> 01:14:25,916
<i>-I won't wait for you on the bridge.
-All of you deserve to die!</i>

906
01:14:26,041 --> 01:14:27,625
<i>Help!</i>

907
01:14:27,708 --> 01:14:29,041
<i>I'll protect you.</i>

908
01:14:29,791 --> 01:14:31,791
<i>Don't be scared.
I'll protect you if anything happens.</i>

909
01:14:31,875 --> 01:14:33,791
<i>I'll strangle you to death!</i>

910
01:14:33,875 --> 01:14:35,875
<i>-Why don't you believe me?
-Ghosts do exist.</i>

911
01:14:35,958 --> 01:14:37,333
<i>-All of you deserve to die!</i>
-Stop it!

912
01:14:38,083 --> 01:14:40,041
<i>You said you'd protect me!</i>

913
01:15:31,375 --> 01:15:32,625
I'm sorry.

914
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,208
Don't kill me.

915
01:15:34,833 --> 01:15:36,208
I don't want to die.

916
01:15:39,083 --> 01:15:40,916
Are you really afraid of dying?

917
01:15:43,250 --> 01:15:46,166
You killed Wen-yao
and the others, didn't you?

918
01:15:46,458 --> 01:15:47,916
You have to die too.

919
01:15:48,125 --> 01:15:49,333
Don't kill me.

920
01:15:49,708 --> 01:15:51,458
I'll do anything you ask me to do.

921
01:15:53,833 --> 01:15:55,791
Do you think I never tried?

922
01:15:57,833 --> 01:15:59,666
She won't let me go.

923
01:16:01,583 --> 01:16:04,125
I shouldn't have broken the spell
on the bridge.

924
01:16:05,583 --> 01:16:07,708
I can't die even if I want to.

925
01:16:08,125 --> 01:16:10,166
But I want to live on!

926
01:16:10,250 --> 01:16:11,541
Stop talking!

927
01:16:13,958 --> 01:16:15,333
It's no better

928
01:16:16,208 --> 01:16:17,916
to live on.

929
01:16:19,083 --> 01:16:21,791
For four years,
every time I close my eyes,

930
01:16:22,583 --> 01:16:25,041
I saw those five faces.

931
01:16:35,708 --> 01:16:38,333
Are you sure you want to live on?

932
01:16:39,250 --> 01:16:41,416
It's a high price to pay.

933
01:16:45,041 --> 01:16:46,750
There must be a way.

934
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,708
There must be a way, right?

935
01:17:05,458 --> 01:17:07,250
Hit my head with it.

936
01:17:07,875 --> 01:17:08,833
Today,

937
01:17:08,916 --> 01:17:10,500
five people must die.

938
01:17:14,333 --> 01:17:15,375
Kill me.

939
01:17:15,666 --> 01:17:16,625
Kill me!

940
01:17:16,708 --> 01:17:19,291
It's easy to keep yourself alive.

941
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:27,125
Will you kill to keep yourself alive?

942
01:17:41,541 --> 01:17:42,791
Come on.

943
01:17:43,541 --> 01:17:44,708
Come on.

944
01:17:45,666 --> 01:17:47,000
Come on!

945
01:17:47,083 --> 01:17:48,583
Kill me and you'll live!

946
01:18:01,458 --> 01:18:04,666
They are Meng Po-ju, Chao Hsin-chiao,
and Li Wen-yao.

947
01:18:05,708 --> 01:18:07,541
Where is the group photo taken in 2016?

948
01:18:07,916 --> 01:18:09,291
Did you find anything?

949
01:18:09,958 --> 01:18:11,500
There is nothing here.

950
01:18:12,625 --> 01:18:13,750
Maybe earlier?

951
01:18:14,333 --> 01:18:15,458
How much earlier?

952
01:18:15,708 --> 01:18:17,125
When did the rumor of the bridge start?

953
01:18:18,083 --> 01:18:19,791
More than 30 years ago, I guess.

954
01:18:23,208 --> 01:18:24,166
Hello?

955
01:18:24,541 --> 01:18:26,458
SEARCH: CAMPUS DEATHS, BRIDGE

956
01:18:28,375 --> 01:18:30,125
The people for the reenactment shoot
are here.

957
01:18:30,583 --> 01:18:31,916
I'll get ready on the bridge.

958
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:34,708
Do you really have to shoot
the scene at midnight?

959
01:18:35,458 --> 01:18:37,000
You wanted it real, right?

960
01:18:37,083 --> 01:18:39,458
It happened exactly four years ago today.

961
01:18:45,958 --> 01:18:48,541
UNKNOWN DEATH ON CAMPUS,
FEMALE STUDENT FOUND UNDER BRIDGE

962
01:18:55,916 --> 01:19:01,208
DEATH ON CAMPUS,
FEMALE STUDENT FOUND UNDER BRIDGE

963
01:19:01,625 --> 01:19:03,583
REPUBLIC OF CHINA CALENDAR,
YEAR 69, FEBRUARY 29

964
01:19:03,666 --> 01:19:05,083
It's February 29 again.

965
01:19:07,958 --> 01:19:09,125
So, something is bound to happen

966
01:19:09,208 --> 01:19:10,375
on February 29 every four years?

967
01:19:10,458 --> 01:19:11,458
11,50 P.M.

968
01:19:19,291 --> 01:19:21,375
Oh, no. Te is on the bridge.

969
01:20:14,333 --> 01:20:16,375
It's hard to live on.

970
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:19,375
I've suffered a lot to survive.

971
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:21,500
If I want to live,

972
01:20:21,958 --> 01:20:23,666
five people must die today.

973
01:20:32,333 --> 01:20:34,416
<i>I heard that people had died
on this bridge.</i>

974
01:20:34,583 --> 01:20:36,166
It has to be fake news.

975
01:20:36,250 --> 01:20:39,000
But the seniors say
it's true that the bridge is haunted.

976
01:20:39,083 --> 01:20:41,750
Seriously? You really believe it?

977
01:20:41,833 --> 01:20:43,958
I don't care as long as we are paid.

978
01:20:44,708 --> 01:20:46,375
-Everyone.
-Yes?

979
01:20:46,708 --> 01:20:50,500
I need you to walk up the stairs
and count the steps.

980
01:20:50,583 --> 01:20:51,750
Then, turn around.

981
01:20:52,208 --> 01:20:53,041
Okay?

982
01:20:53,125 --> 01:20:54,250
-Yes.
-Yes.

983
01:20:58,875 --> 01:20:59,875
Ready.

984
01:21:01,208 --> 01:21:02,166
Five.

985
01:21:02,875 --> 01:21:03,791
Four.

986
01:21:04,791 --> 01:21:05,750
Three.

987
01:21:06,833 --> 01:21:07,708
Two.

988
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:16,500
-One, two, three, four, five,
-One, two, three, four, five,

989
01:21:16,708 --> 01:21:19,458
-six, seven,
-six, seven,

990
01:21:19,958 --> 01:21:24,125
-eight, nine, ten,
-eight, nine, ten,

991
01:21:24,958 --> 01:21:29,875
-eleven, twelve, thirteen,
-eleven, twelve, thirteen,

992
01:21:33,291 --> 01:21:34,500
-fourteen.
-fourteen.

993
01:23:22,958 --> 01:23:24,458
I need your help

994
01:23:25,958 --> 01:23:27,625
to break this cycle.

995
01:26:39,833 --> 01:26:40,958
<i>-Five.
-Five.</i>

996
01:26:41,416 --> 01:26:42,416
<i>-Four.
-Four.</i>

997
01:26:42,833 --> 01:26:43,833
<i>-Three.
-Three.</i>

998
01:26:44,333 --> 01:26:45,416
<i>-Two.
-Two.</i>

999
01:26:46,083 --> 01:26:47,250
<i>-One.
-One.</i>

1000
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:54,750
<i>It's your turn.</i>
